TODO:

- organize files (learn about namespaces?)
- implement backpropogation/train
- test the `predict` method in `NeuralNetwork`
- test different variations of networks 
(i.e. different numbers of layers, inputs, outputs, etc.)

Long-term goals (emphasis on *long-term*):

- utilize a testing framework to more rigorously test my implementation
- implement other "types" of networks
(could start by learning what other types there even are)

If whoever is reading this wants to give me feedback:

1. any immediate problems with my implementation?
2. how can I "C++ify" my code?
3. how can I improve memory + time efficiency?
4. any of my formatting go against common best practices?
